# 2-NORM OF A MATRIX
## Aim:
To write a program to find the 2-norm of the matrix and display the result in two decimal places.
## Equipment’s required:
1.	Hardware – PCs
2.	Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner
## Algorithm:
	1. Get the input matrix using np.array()
	2. The 2-Norm of a matrix is given by 
![norm](./normeqn1.jpg)
    
    3. Find the 2-norm of the matrix using np.linalg.norm()
	4. Print the norm of the matrix in two decimal places.
## Program:
```
Program to find 2-norm of a matrix.
Developed by: RITHIGA SRI.B
RegisterNumber: 21500732

import numpy as np
n=eval(input())
val=np.linalg.norm(n,2)
print("{:.2f}".format(val))
```
## Sample Input:
![norm1](./input.jpg)
## Sample Output:
![OUTPUT](./output.png)

## Result
Thus the program for 2-norm of a matrix is written and verified.
